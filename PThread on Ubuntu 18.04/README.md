## **_Step-by-step Building and Testing Instructions_** ##

Choose a benchmark and follow the steps below.

PThread Paralel Version

1.Create new benchmark_name_pthread.c project in file. 
2.Replace the contents of Relevant_Experiment/relevant_experiment_pthread.c 
3.Compile code --> gcc relevant_experiment_pthread.c -o MyProgram -lpthread
4. Run program-->  ./MyProgram
5. Record execution time
6. Change number of thread in code
7. Repeat steps 3, 4 and 5

Sequential Version

1.Create new benchmark_name_sequential.c project in file. 
2.Replace the contents of Relevant_Experiment/relevant_experiment_sequential.c 
3.Compile code --> gcc relevant_experiment_sequential.c -o MyProgram 
4.Run program-->  ./MyProgram
5.Record execution time
